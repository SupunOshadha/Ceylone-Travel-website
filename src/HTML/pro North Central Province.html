                    Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is among the most ancient trees in Sri Lanka that even today are thriving in the
                    Mahamewna Gardens of Anuradhapura. This special tree is said to have grown out of a cutting that was
                    brought here from Bodh Gaya in India. It is believed that it has been brought from the very same
                    place where Gautama Buddha had attained enlightenment, thus making it one of the most popular places
                    to visit at Anuradhapura for pilgrims and spiritual souls. It was cared for by the ancient kings and
                    queens of Sri Lanka, as well as many Buddhist leaders. Flourishing even in the harshest of
                    conditions, this tree is said to have such tranquil beauty that it instills a sense of calm and
                    peace in visitors.

                    The monastery of Jetavanaramaya is one of the largest monasteries in Anuradhapura. In fact, it was
                    once the third-tallest structure in the whole world. The legend surrounding this ancient sanctum is
                    that it’s the same place where Buddha’s sash or belt was tied and preserved for a long time, and
                    that is what fascinates worshippers and history geeks from around the world and brings them here in
                    large numbers every year. Luring in travelers with its enchanting historical significance,
                    Jetavanaramaya still remains one of the largest holy structures in the world and is home to about
                    10,000 monks.

                    Ruwanwelisaya Stupa is among the largest stupas (also called dagobas) in Sri Lanka and one of the
                    most prominent places to visit in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Built long ago by King Dutugamunu, this
                    beautiful stupa is nestled right in the heart of the heritage city of Anuradhapura. Also called Maha
                    Stupa, this adorned structure is over 338 feet tall and has large paved courts as well as platforms
                    that all add a unique architectural touch to this magnificent structure. Recent renovations have
                    earned this shrine the privilege of being one of the most revered sanctums of worship in
                    Anuradhapura.

                    This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the perfect specimen of Lord Buddha statue created with
                    solid stone. It was built during the reign of the great King Parakramabahu (1153-1186 A.C). The
                    reclining Buddha sculpture is 14 m long, which represents Buddha entering the Nirvana stage. The
                    sculptor artist of the Gal Vihara possessed a great deal of skill and expertise in the field of
                    stone sculpture in the land of Sri Lanka.

                    headless Buddha statue is still standing. The height of the statue is almost over 14m high. It was
                    built by the great King Parakramabahu.

                    The Rankot Vihara stupa had been created by Nissanka Malla of the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. He

                    keeping in mind the old tradition of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya. It has an impressive height of
                    54 meters. The stone inscription near to the stupa describes it to be known as “Ruwanweli”
