                    Munneswaram Temple is considered to be one of the most important sanctuaries in Sri Lanka which has
                    been devoted to Shiva. It is believed that Durga is invincible, Shiva teaches wisdom and Vishnu is
                    the protector. It is considered to be the home of the medieval sculpture of Hindu Pandya who reigned
                    in Southern India. This temple is a pilgrimage during the time of full moon in the month of February
                    and the ending of August. There is a competition in which devotees take part where they have to
                    break the open coconuts as offerings on the sacred rocks.

                    There is a huge lion staircase which leads to the temple of Buddha with a sacred tooth relic. These
                    stairs are half-way up to the hillside and they are considered to be a masterpiece of the citadel of
                    Yapahuwa but unfortunately, now they are in ruins. The granite rock which emerges from thick
                    vegetation against which the fortress of Bhuvanekabahu I has been built was earlier a lower town and
                    a palace. Now it has become a striking site which provides an excellent view of the countryside
                    which surrounds it.

                    The temple got its name as the silver temple because it has been built on a rocky outcrop over a
                    mine which is of silver. There are two shrines which are superimposed and partly carved out of the
                    rocks. They make up the Silver Temple which is also known as Ridi Viharaya and it was first built by
                    King Duttu Gemunu in the 2C BCE. There are many caves in here and in one cave there is a long
                    reclining idol of Buddha which has an approximate height of about 9 m. The walls of the temple are
                    covered with paintings which depict divinities. A person could enjoy the spectacular view of the
                    mountain range of Knuckles from dagoba at the top of the hill.
