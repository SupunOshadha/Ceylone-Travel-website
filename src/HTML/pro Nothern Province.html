                    Also known as Madukanda Sri Dalada Viharaya, Madukanda Vihara is a historic Buddhist temple. The
                    historic religious site is located within the Madukanda village, which is at a distance of 4
                    kilometres from Vavuniya. The Madukanda village and the sacred temple date back to at least 4th
                    century AD.
                    <br><br>
                    As per the historians, during the journey of the holy Buddha’s tooth relic, Madukanda was the 4th
                    resting point. It also happens to be the first location where the first Dalada Maligaya (House of
                    the Sacred Tooth Relic) was founded. Pilgrims who intend to follow the original trail often stop at
                    Madukanda Vihara for rest.
                    <br><br>
                    Madukanda Vihara is the relic house where the sacred tooth was venerated until the temple in
                    Anuradhapura was built. One can witness fine craftsmanship in the form of intricate carvings made on
                    the granite stepping stones. In addition to the temple, one can even visit the Stupa nearby which
                    lacks the adornments as compared to the Vihara but is of equal historical value.

                    the son of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, first landed at Mihintale. It is from here that the son
                    carried out his father’s order of spreading Buddhism on Sri Lankan soil.

                    rocks to reach the Maha Stupa of Mihintale.
                    <br><br>
                    In the months of June, Poson Poya is celebrated at this site, which results in a great inflow of
                    tourists and pilgrims from all over. The festival marks the birth of Buddhism and the arrival of
                    Mahinda.
