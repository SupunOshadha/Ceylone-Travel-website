                    Built several years ago on a massive piece of land in Galle, the Galle Dutch Fort was used by the
                    Portuguese until the Dutch took over it. The British finally sealed the fort as theirs with a lot of
                    re-building and renovation. The unique blends that led to the standing of this monumental structure
                    are now listed under the UNESCO World Heritage Sites thus deserving a substantial place on the list
                    of places to visit in Galle.
