                    Considered as one of the most important temples of Buddhists in Sri Lanka, the Temple of Tooth Relic
                    is located to the north of Kandy Lake and is one of the most remarkable places to visit in Kandy Sri
                    Lanka. The sacred tooth of Lord Buddha enshrined in the temple makes it one of the popular Kandy
                    tourist places. The room housing the tooth is open to devotees to offer their prayers. However,
                    nobody gets to see the tooth because it is kept in a golden casket inside a stupa-like structure.
                    The temple is housed in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy. One of the best
                    places to see in Kandy, this temple is of great importance due to the belief of the country on the
                    tooth. The temple has rituals thrice a day. The temple was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                    1988. The temple still stands strong even after facing attacks twice.

                    Along with the outside, tourists need to visit the inside of the temple to actually appreciate the
                    architecture. There are holes in the walls which contain lamps lit using coconut oil. Tourists need
                    to pay the entry fees and they should visit between 5:30 AM and 8:00 PM.

                    Knuckles Mountain range is an unusual terrestrial landform located in Matale and Kandy, in Central
                    Province, Sri Lanka. The range is a World Heritage Conservation Area and is relatively untouched.
                    The range features 34 peaks, ranging between 900 metres to 2000 metres. Five of these mountain peaks
                    make the formation of a clenched fist.
                    <br><br>
                    The name was given by the British, and the locals call this range 'Dumbara Kanduvetiya', which means
                    mist-laden mountains. The knuckles Mountain Range is called so because of its uncanny resemblance to
                    the fingers of a clenched fist.
                    <br><br>
                    The range, with its grasslands, rugged peaks, meandering roads and cascading streams and waterfalls
                    are a vibrant biodiversity zone. Despite being only 0.03% of the country's area, this zone consists
                    of 34% of Sri Lanka's endemic vegetation. The forest cover of the region includes dry evergreen
                    forests, montane forests, sub-montane forests, dry and wet savanna etc.
                    <br><br>
                    The range faces two significant threats: constant cultivation of cardamom has deprived the forest of
                    its vegetation cover, and a plant species called Mist Flower, which spreads into the woods and
                    destroys the vegetation. However, there are some local and global initiatives to preserve and
                    restore the cover. Currently, watershed conservation and restoration project is being undertaken
                    here full-fledged.
