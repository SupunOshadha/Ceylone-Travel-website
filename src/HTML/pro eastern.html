                    Semicircular curl soft sand, cool sea wind, serene bluish landscapes, and beautiful light blue
                    horizon keep Arugam bay well reputed for its aesthetic beauty. It’s a well-known point break that
                    everyone recommends to have maximum surfing experience from the whole country. If you are a surfer,
                    take your surfboard and explore the energy of the blue waves. You will swear there is no experience
                    like that for your entire life.
                    <br><br>
                    It is comparatively small with other beaches. But, there are always several people hanging around
                    the place and feel the scenic beauty, especially in its world-famous rush months. If you are not
                    already a surfer, there are various stuff you can still do. What about the swing in a hammock while
                    drinking a fresh King Coconut in the evening? Either having breakfast or lunch in a beachfront
                    guesthouse or an Oceanside restaurant? Or climb up to the famous Elephant Rock which is located at
                    an end of the bay and have a view of the whole area.
                    <br><br>
                    Arugam Bay is surrounded by greater wildlife. If you stay a few days, be aware of elephants who pass
                    the area every morning and evening. And if you are a lonely visitor, better avoid unknown waterways
                    and rivers as crocodiles are active here. Muhudu Maha Viharaya isn’t far away from Arugam Bay which
                    is a charming temple located in dunes in Portugal. You can make a combined visit to the beach along
                    with this nice temple.

                    Another amiable well-known eco-tourism attraction has located in the southeast corner of the
                    country. Authentic Jungle experience to be having at the heart of the wilderness. A popular bird
                    sanctuary in Sri Lanka, being a prime bird-watching destination of the whole world. Wetland zones
                    begird with dry zone thorny forests with a wide range of aquatic plants and trees.
                    Many multitudes of birds breed roosts in a “Kumana Villu” which is the most significant feature
                    here. A two-hundred-hectare natural swamp lake in the neighborhood of Kumana and Yala National park.
                    This huge swamp is colonization for many species of water birds.
                    <br><br>
                    The swamp is undergoing occasional submergence with seawater which lets many water birds nest during
                    their breeding seasons. Pelicans, Spoonbills, Herons, Painted Trorks, and White Ibis including
                    several endemic verities. The Black-necked stock is a very rare bird that has been nearly observed
                    to live in the swamp. Most importantly, a large number of threatened reptiles are breeding and
                    nesting here, three rare turtle species, and a globally vulnerable crocodile species.
                    <br><br>
                    Apart from the beautiful birdlife, there are endemic, migrant, and endangered mammal species.
                    Elephants, Leopards, Wild Boars, Bears, and Fishing cats are often found hunting and feeding around
                    the Swamp. Yala East, is another name for this, is less crowded and lower in animal density,
                    compared to the busy neighbor. If you have an idea of visiting Kumana, better read some papers and
                    search on google before visiting this national park.

                <img src="../IMG/Buddhangala-Monastery.jpg" class="content-img">

                <p class="content-text">
                    An ancient monastery stands deep in the jungle, an outcrop of five massive rocks, lost in the
                    chronicles enclosed with a dense wilderness. The jungle around the monastery infested with wild
                    animals let the pleasance remain silent for thousands of years in the rural Digamadulla area. It
                    enlisted in the least-known historic places in Sri Lanka. <br><br>
                    The name, Buddhangala derived from the shape of the rock formation which looked similar to Lord
                    Buddha lying on a floor. Hence, occupied by the name, Buddhangala. The monastery has been abandoned
                    over centuries due to the transpose of Kingdoms in old Sri Lanka. It wasn’t even documented until if
                    found in 1964 by a young monk who traveled along the dene. After founding the ruins of the
                    monastery, he has cleared the surrounding into a fairer level together with another monk.
                    <br><br>
                    Years later, the monastery became popular as the ancient relics emerged through the excavation.
                    Carefully enshrined golden lotus flowers, a gold casket was found through excavation which are
                    believed to be consecrated by a private donor. The casket is believed to be created in the 5th
                    century according to the characteristics of the outer golden plates.
                    <br><br>
                    Years later, in 1974, there had been built a bell-shaped new Sthupa by the former president, William
                    Gopallawa. But, once again it faced a darker period in the civil war of Sri Lanka with terrorism.
                    Until then, it remains quiet and unpopular without the considerable attention of the government up
                    to now.

                    of beach that has ideally saved the tsunami proof all around. Kallady beach is a stunning shoreline
                    on the east bank of Sri Lanka. Decent place to spend your evening in leisure and appreciate the dusk
