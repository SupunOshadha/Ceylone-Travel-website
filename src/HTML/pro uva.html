                    Nature lovers and all those tourists wanting to explore some adventure won’t miss the 64-meters high
                    Dunhinda Falls waterfall in Badulla, Sri Lanka. As this popular fall is located at a distance of
                    fewer than 5 kilometers from the city area, tourists plan their visits at ease. Famous amongst all
                    Sri Lankan waterfalls, this waterfall has gained immense popularity. In fact, it is also mentioned
                    in some of the literary works. Local and international travelers ensure that Dunhinda Falls are
                    added in their itineraries. It won’t be wrong to say that a Sri Lankan tour will remain incomplete
                    without visiting this beautiful waterfall.

                    Set amidst lush forestlands and scenic tea hills, the Nine Arches Bridge is placed over a gorge. It
                    spans over a length of 91 meters and 24 meters tall above the ground. As the name suggests, the
                    bridge consists of nine arches, and it is indeed a great feat of engineering. The surrounding is
                    surreal, and it is embellished in greenery – a lush jungle in the background, oodles of tea plants
                    below and the bridge’s immediate surrounding, this sets a scene that will indeed leave you
                    mesmerised!
                    <br><br>
                    The bridge was built during 1921 and it is located at an elevation of 3100 meters above sea level.
                    Constructed using stones, bricks, and cement the bridge boasts an iconic design and it is regarded
                    as one of the strongest structures that have been made during the colonial era. Being a site that
                    features stunning architecture and splendorous views, the Nine Arches Bridge has become a popular
                    destination and is frequented by locals and foreigners alike.

                    Maligawila, or Maligavila is a village in Sri Lanka, approximately 15 kilometers (9.3 mi) south from
                    Monaragala and 9 kilometers (5.6 mi) from Okkampitiya in the Monaragala District. It is the site of
                    several important archaeological pieces, including a free-standing 11 meters (36 ft 1.1 in) or 12
                    meters (39 ft 4.4 in) tall limestone statue of Buddha, claimed in some quarters to be the tallest
                    free-standing statue of Buddha in the world, though the Avukana Buddha Statue is also said to be
                    taller. This Buddha draws many tourists to the region. It also boasts the Avalokitesvara statue, a
                    10 meters (32 ft 9.7 in) limestone portrait. These statues, which were discovered in the 1950s and
                    restored between 1989 and 1991, are believed to have been commissioned by the 7th-century prince
                    Agghabodhi. There is additionally a 10th-century historical pillar placed in the 10th year of the
                    rule of Mahinda IV (956-972 AD).
