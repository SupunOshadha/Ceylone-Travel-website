                    This Buddhist temple complex was constructed in the late 19th century. The temple is a place of
                    worship but also looks to educate people about Buddhism. It's also like a museum, as it showcases a
                    lot of physical items, from jewelry to coins and even a vintage Rolls-Royce.

                    You can also view the temple's most sacred religious relic, a lock of the Buddha's hair, as well as
                    a sacred tree around which the temple was built. Visit during the February full moon (called "Poya")
                    to see the Gangaramaya Temple's annual religious ceremony, which includes a procession led by the
                    temple's elephant.

                    One of the coolest places to visit in Colombo is also one of the city's newest attractions. The
                    Colombo Lotus Tower is South Asia's tallest freestanding structure (368 meters/1,168 feet), and a
                    trip to the top rewards visitors with unobstructed views across Colombo and the surrounding
                    cityscape and sea.

                    The tower, which houses a lot of telecommunications equipment, has a telecom museum, a shopping
                    mall, a revolving fine dining restaurant, a hotel, and indoor and outdoor observation areas. The
                    tower is also a sight to see from the outside - it's covered in LED lighting and presents seasonal
                    themed lighting displays each night.

                    The Lotus Tower, designed to replicate a lotus bulb and flower, simultaneously represents the
                    historic culture of the country and its focus on the future.

                    with the name Henarathgoda Botanical Garden. In Sri Lanka, the first rubber tree was planted here
                    and is still present in the town. The first seed was planted by the original owner, Muhandiam Amaris
